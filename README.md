# Diabetes Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze diabetes data and develop machine learning models for diabetes diagnosis. The analysis was performed using 768 samples and 8 features. Each feature is used to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.

## Project Overview

1. **Dataset Overview:**
   - The dataset includes various features such as age, body mass index (BMI), glucose level, blood pressure, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Missing values handling, outlier detection, and normalization were performed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizations and basic statistical analyses were conducted to understand the data better.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) were applied for diabetes diagnosis.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other metrics.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualizations.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning models and evaluation.
